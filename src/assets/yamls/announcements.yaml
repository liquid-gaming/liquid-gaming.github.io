  title: Armor Claim Rule Change
  date: 2021-06-08
  content: |-
    Hello all we've made a change to our vehicle claim rules on all of our squad servers effective immediately.
    The new rule reads:

    "Squads NAMED after a vehicle get PRIORITY for that vehicle. Only ONE vehicle type allowed per squad. Armor (generic) gets leftovers."

    With this rule change, we will no longer allow for double vehicle claims such as BRAD/TANK, BMP/TANK, STRYKER/MRAP, etc. As another reminder, squads named ARMOR will lose claim if any other squad has a more specific claim over the vehicle.

    We are proud to announce that LiQ has been included in the whitelist mod test with OWI, and we have chosen to run Galactic Contention! This mod is a little large as it is a rewrite of a lot of the core functions, it sits at about 30 GB.
    This is the rotation we are running with:

    GC_BespinPlatforms_AAS_V2
    GC_Kashyyyk_INV_V1
    GC_CatoNeimoidia_AAS_V1
    GC_Galban_AAS_V1_P1
    GC_Sullust_INV_V2
    GC_Miniosis_AAS_V2
    GC_NabooPlains_AAS_V1
    GC_Sesid_AAS_V2
    GC_YavinVillage_AAS_V1
    GC_Kadavo_INV_V1
    GC_Kashyyyk_AAS_V1
    GC_Galban_AAS_V1
    GC_BespinPlatforms_AAS_V1
    GC_Sullust_AAS_V1
    GC_Miniosis_AAS_V1
    GC_Mygeeto_AAS_V1

    We have been advised not to run some layers due to small issues that effect game play, so ADMINS do not manually swap maps.

    We hope you will be able to help us populate the server and play on this over the next few weeks.

    Additionally, The Potato Fields and 56th is running a new map called Panjwia and the French Faction (French Faction from Friday), so keep an eye out in the main server browser for that.

    Thanks again and if this goes well we hope OWI will allow us to run any mods on a live licensed server.
